# Simulation of solar heating system

If you are cloning from the git repo, first
```
git clone https://github.com/mohittkr/solar_water_heating.git
cd solar_water_heating
```

To run the simulation, run
```
./run.sh

```

To generate plots, run
```
./plot.sh

```

The script files generates a text file containing the temperature profile in a tank and a plot for the temperature profile.


Also, pushed into the repo are some figures that I generated during my study. Please feel free to modify names of the figure and text files in the simulation file and the plot script file by varying the parameters in the global variables header file.
